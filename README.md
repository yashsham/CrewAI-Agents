# CrewAI-Agents

CrewAI-Agents is a Python-based framework for building and managing autonomous AI agents that can perform tasks, run workflows, and interact with APIs. This project is designed for developers and enthusiasts who want to experiment with AI-driven process automation.

## Features

```bash
# Multi-Agent System: Create and manage multiple AI agents with distinct roles.
# Task Automation: Automate repetitive tasks using Python scripts.
# API Integration: Connect agents to external services and APIs.
# Configurable Workflows: Define workflows that agents can follow independently.
# Environment Management: Supports `.env` files for secure configuration of API keys and credentials.
```

## Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yashsham/CrewAI-Agents.git
cd CrewAI-Agents

# 2. Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# 3. Activate the virtual environment
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# 4. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Set up environment variables
# Create a `.env` file with your credentials and configuration, for example:
echo "API_KEY=your_api_key" >> .env
echo "OTHER_CONFIG=value" >> .env
```

## Usage

```bash
# Run the main script to start the AI agents
python main.py

# Define agents and tasks in agents.py and tasks.py for custom workflows
```

If you want, I can also **add a small “Quick Start Example” section in bash format** showing how to create a new agent and run a task. This will make your README look much more hands-on and practical.  

Do you want me to add that?
